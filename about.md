This is an example of a Jekyll site with the correct security headers to get an A+ on Mozilla Observatory. It is meant to be used as a boilerplate to start from. It uses the minima theme, default for new Jekyll projects. [Read about how and why I built it](https://ogdenstudios.xyz/2019/03/02/how-do-i-get-an-a-plus-mozilla-observatory-jekyll-netlify.html) or [fork it on GitHub](https://github.com/ogdenstudios/secure-jekyll-site).
